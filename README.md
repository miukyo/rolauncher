# RoLauncher

## What is this monstrosity?

RoLauncher is a custom Roblox launcher that I threw together because I can :P

It's basically Roblox but with extra steps and questionable life choices.

## ✨ Features (and I use that term loosely)

- **Account Switcher** - Switch between your army of Roblox accounts faster than you can say "why do I have this many accounts"
- **Game Shortcuts Per Account** - Make shortcut of your favorite games to each account because apparently we're optimizing our Roblox workflow now :P
- **It Launches** - Literally the bare minimum. It opens Roblox. Sometimes.
- **Auto-Updater** - Because who wants to manually update software in 2024?
- **Fast?** - Well, as fast as it can be, given the circumstances.

## 🐛 Known Issues (aka "It's not a bug, it's a feature")

**Short answer:** Yes, there are bugs.

**Long answer:** Oh boy, where do I start? This thing is held together with duct tape, prayers, and whatever I remembered from that one tutorial I watched at 3 AM. Expect:
- Things to break
- Things to not work
- Things to work but in a weird way
- Your computer to judge you silently

## 🚧 Roadmap (Things I'll probably add someday)

- More features (TBD when I figure out what else is needed)
- Bug fixes (lol)
- Making it actually stable (ambitious, I know)
- Maybe some proper error handling? Who knows!

## 🛠️ Installation & Building

### For Normal People
Just grab the latest release from the releases page and run it. Easy peasy.

### For the Smart Souls Who Want to Build It
```bash
# Install dependencies (you'll need uv and bun/npm, obviously)
npm install  # or npm install
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml

# Development mode (hot reload and all that jazz)
npm run dev

# Build the whole thing
npm run build
```

Yeah, that's it. If it doesn't work, check if you have Python and Node.js installed. And maybe pray a little.

## 📝 License

MIT probably? I honestly just want people to use this if it helps them.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a hobby project made by someone who just wanted to switch accounts faster. It's not affiliated with Roblox Corporation. Use at your own risk. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome! Especially if you know what you're doing because I certainly don't.
